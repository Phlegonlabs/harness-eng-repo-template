# packages/shared AGENTS.md

Read the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) first. This file adds workspace-specific guidance for `packages/shared`.

---

## Purpose

`packages/shared` is the reusable library workspace consumed by application workspaces. Treat its export surface as the stable contract for cross-workspace reuse.

---

## Layer Guidance

The harness linter allows all six layers in this workspace:

`Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI`

The current template intentionally uses a smaller subset:
- `src/index.ts` is the package export barrel.
- `src/types/` contains foundational types.
- `src/service/` contains reusable business logic and shared runtime-adjacent helpers such as the logger wrapper.

If you want to restrict this workspace further, change the machine-readable rules and the code together. Do not claim tighter limits here than the linter actually enforces.

---

## Public API

- Cross-workspace imports must go through `@harness-template/shared` or another declared exported subpath.
- Do not deep-import from `packages/shared/src/...`.
- Re-export new shared capabilities from `src/index.ts` unless there is a deliberate exported subpath in `package.json`.

---

## Validation

- Run `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, and `bun run typecheck` from this workspace when changing shared code.
- Run `bun run harness:validate` from the repo root before handoff.
