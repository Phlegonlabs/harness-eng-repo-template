# Harness Template

A production-ready **strict monorepo template** for agent-first engineering, built on **Bun + Turbo**. It gives your team a fully structured repository — with machine-readable rules, built-in validation, planning tools, and documentation surfaces — so you can start shipping features from day one instead of spending weeks on setup.

---

## What Is This?

As AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, etc.) become capable of writing entire features and even full codebases, the core engineering challenge shifts: it's no longer just about *writing code* — it's about **designing environments that enable agents (and humans) to write reliable code consistently**.

**Harness Engineering** is the methodology behind this template. The key idea:

> Encode your architectural constraints, conventions, and quality standards as **machine-readable rules that live in the repository itself** — so both linters and AI agents consume the same source of truth.

Without this, every new agent session re-discovers (or re-violates) the same conventions, architectural drift accumulates silently, and code quality degrades because agents optimize locally instead of globally.

This template solves that by giving you:

- **A strict monorepo scaffold** with workspaces, dependency layers, and naming conventions already wired up
- **Golden rules as JSON files** that linters enforce at commit time and agents read before generating code
- **A full validation pipeline** (`harness:validate`) that catches layer violations, forbidden patterns, file size bloat, and entropy drift
- **Planning and orchestration tools** that break your product docs into milestones and tasks — then suggest which skills to load for each phase
- **Repository-owned documentation** as the single source of truth — decisions live in `docs/`, not in Slack threads or chat history

---

## Who Is This For?

| Persona | Situation | How This Template Helps |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Founding engineer** | Starting a new product codebase and needs a production-shaped repo immediately | Land your first vertical slice without rebuilding tooling from scratch — workspaces, validation, CI, and docs are ready out of the box |
| **Platform or tech lead** | Standardizing how agents and humans work in the same repository across a team | Provides repeatable structure, enforceable rules, validation gates, and handoff conventions that every contributor (human or AI) follows |
| **Product engineer using AI agents** | Edits application code with AI assistance every day | Work inside a repo whose conventions are obvious, machine-readable, and automatically enforced — no guessing, no drift |

---

## Key Features

### Strict Monorepo Layout

Three default workspaces out of the box — `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/shared` — orchestrated by **Turbo** for fast, parallelized builds. Each workspace has its own `package.json` with `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and `test` scripts. Cross-workspace sharing goes through public package exports (e.g., `@<project>/shared`); deep imports into another workspace's `src/` or `dist/` are forbidden.

### Six-Layer Dependency Model

Every workspace follows a strict import hierarchy enforced at lint time:

```
Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI
```

Each layer may only import from layers to its left. This prevents spaghetti dependencies, makes refactoring predictable, and gives agents a clear mental model of where code belongs.

| Layer | What Goes Here | Can Import From |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| `types` | Type definitions, interfaces, enums | *(nothing — foundational)* |
| `config` | Configuration, constants, environment | `types` |
| `repo` | Data access, storage, external API clients | `types`, `config` |
| `service` | Business logic, domain rules | `types`, `config`, `repo` |
| `runtime` | Entrypoints, servers, CLI handlers | `types`, `config`, `repo`, `service` |
| `ui` | UI components, views, pages | all layers |

### Machine-Readable Golden Rules

Architectural conventions are encoded as JSON files in `harness/rules/`, not as prose that agents might misinterpret:

| Rule File | What It Enforces |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `dependency-layers.json` | Import direction between layers |
| `file-size-limits.json` | Max lines per file (default: 500 for source, 300 for tests, 1000 for docs) |
| `forbidden-patterns.json` | Patterns that must never appear (secrets, `console.log`, TODO stubs, commented-out code) |
| `naming-conventions.json` | File and module naming standards |

### Full Validation Pipeline

One command checks everything:

```bash
bun run harness:validate
```

This runs, in order:
1. **`harness:doctor`** — Repository health check (is the project initialized? are required files present?)
2. **Linters** — Dependency layer violations, file size limits, forbidden patterns, naming conventions
3. **Structural tests** — Regression tests for the harness runtime itself, ensuring rules are tested, not just documented
4. **Entropy scans** — Detects pattern violations and code quality drift

### Planning & Orchestration

Turn your product and architecture docs into actionable work:

- **`harness:plan`** — Reads `docs/product.md` and `docs/architecture.md`, then generates milestones and tasks in `docs/progress.md`
- **`harness:orchestrate`** — Shows the next task to work on and suggests which skills to load
- **`harness:parallel-dispatch`** — Allocates isolated git worktrees so multiple milestones can progress in parallel without conflicts

### Repository-Owned Documentation

All important context lives in the repo — not in chat history, not in external wikis:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/product.md` | Product requirements — what you're building and why |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System architecture — how it's structured, constraints, layer model |
| `docs/progress.md` | Current milestones, tasks, and worktree dispatch status |
| `docs/decisions/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — why specific choices were made |
| `docs/glossary.md` | Shared terminology so agents and humans use the same language |

### Progressive Skill System

Agents don't need to read everything upfront. Skills are loaded on demand based on the current task phase:

| Skill | When to Load |
|-------|-------------|
| `skills/research/SKILL.md` | Before working in an unfamiliar area of the codebase |
| `skills/implementation/SKILL.md` | When implementing a new feature |
| `skills/testing/SKILL.md` | When writing or improving tests |
| `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` | When reviewing a PR or validating changes |
| `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` | Before opening a PR or deploying |

### Git Hooks & CI

- **Pre-commit hook** — Runs `harness:lint` automatically before every commit, catching violations early
- **GitHub Actions CI** — Runs `harness:validate` on every push and pull request
- Install hooks with: `bun run harness:install-hooks`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <this-repo> my-project && cd my-project
bun install

# 2. Initialize with your project name
bun run harness:init -- my-project

# 3. Build and test to confirm everything works
bun run build
bun run test

# 4. Run the full validation suite
bun run harness:validate
```

### Recommended Adoption Order

1. **Initialize** — Run `harness:init` to personalize the project name and baseline docs
2. **Customize your docs** — Replace the starter content in `docs/product.md` (what you're building) and `docs/architecture.md` (how it's structured)
3. **Generate your plan** — Run `harness:plan` when the docs are ready to produce milestones and tasks
4. **Start building** — Use `harness:orchestrate` to see the next task and recommended skills
5. **Validate before every handoff** — Treat `harness:validate` as the pre-push and pre-PR gate

## How It Works (Standard Workflow)

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  Initialize  │ ──→ │  Customize Docs  │ ──→ │  Plan (auto)  │
│ harness:init │     │ product.md       │     │ harness:plan  │

                    │ harness:validate │     │ Build features │
                    │                  │     │ per milestone  │
                    └───────┬──────────┘     └───────────────┘
                            │
                    ┌───────▼──────────┐
                    │   Ship / PR      │
                    │ Push & merge     │
                    └──────────────────┘
```

1. **Initialize** — `harness:init` personalizes the template with your project name, updating configs and docs
2. **Customize docs** — Write your product requirements in `docs/product.md` and your architecture constraints in `docs/architecture.md`
3. **Plan** — `harness:plan` reads your docs and generates milestones and tasks in `docs/progress.md`
4. **Execute** — Work on milestones one at a time (or in parallel using `harness:parallel-dispatch` for isolated worktrees). Load skills as needed via `harness:orchestrate`
5. **Validate** — Run `harness:validate` before every handoff. If it fails, fix the issue — don't ship broken state
6. **Ship** — Push, open a PR, and merge. CI will run `harness:validate` again as a safety net

## Architecture Decision Records

Decisions and their rationale are documented in `docs/decisions/`:

| ADR | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| [000-template.md](docs/decisions/000-template.md) | ADR template format for this repository |
| [001-harness-engineering.md](docs/decisions/001-harness-engineering.md) | Adopt Harness Engineering — encode constraints as machine-readable rules in the repo |
| [002-monorepo-template.md](docs/decisions/002-monorepo-template.md) | Adopt Bun monorepo with Turbo orchestration as the default project structure |
| [003-strict-monorepo-enforcement.md](docs/decisions/003-strict-monorepo-enforcement.md) | Enforce strict monorepo rules — layer violations caught at lint time, deep imports forbidden |

---

## Notes

- **`harness:discover --reset`** is optional. Use it when the team wants a guided interview to fill in PRD and architecture docs before coding begins.
- **`packages/shared`** is the default home for shared contracts and reusable logic, but shared code must still respect the dependency layer model.
- **Keep decisions in `docs/`**, not in chat history. Anything important must be written into the repository so agents and future contributors can find it.
- The template validates both before and after `harness:init`. The only intentional doctor warning in the untouched template is `project_name === "harness-template"` before initialization.
