# AGENTS.md

> Primary entry point for AI agents working in this repository.
> This file is intentionally self-contained: read it first, then load deeper docs only when the current task needs them.

> If this file and the runtime disagree, the runtime and validation suite win.

## Purpose

This template assumes agents do the planning, coding, testing, and handoff work.
Humans define the environment, review artifacts, and make the final decisions.

The goal of this file is to minimize session startup cost while keeping the non-negotiable rules explicit.

---

## Read Order

### Small tasks
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CODEX.md` or `CLAUDE.md` for tool-specific behavior

### Medium tasks
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CODEX.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
3. `docs/architecture.md`
4. `docs/progress.md`

### Large tasks
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CODEX.md` or `CLAUDE.md`
3. `docs/product.md`
4. `docs/architecture.md`
5. `docs/progress.md`
6. `docs/internal/orchestrator-workflow.md` if you are changing the task loop itself
7. `docs/internal/dependency-layers.md` if you are changing layer policy or lint behavior
8. `docs/internal/boundaries.md` if you are changing approval boundaries

Load only what the task requires. Do not bulk-read `docs/internal/` by default.

## Core Rules

1. Follow the dependency order inside each workspace:
   `Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI`

2. Keep files under the configured limits.
   Source default: 500 lines
   Tests: 300 lines
   Docs: 1000 lines

3. Run `bun run harness:validate` before handoff.
   If the repo is broken, fix it before stopping.

4. For in-flight tasks, run `bun run harness:evaluate --task <id>` before considering the task done.

5. Use conventional commits:
   `type(scope): description`
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `harness`

6. No backwards-compat shims.
   No `_old`, `_v2`, dead exports, commented-out code, or TODO placeholders.

7. The repository is the only durable memory.
   If a decision matters to the next agent, write it into `docs/`.

---

## Boundaries

### Always do
- Run `bun run harness:validate` before handoff.
- Follow the dependency layer rules.
- Update `docs/` when architecture or workflow decisions change.
- Keep command/documentation surfaces in sync with runtime behavior.
- Delete unused code instead of preserving compatibility scaffolding.

### Ask first
- Adding a new external dependency
- Creating a new top-level directory
- Modifying files in `harness/rules/`
- Changing CI or workflow automation
- Making breaking schema or API contract changes
- Taking irreversible infrastructure actions

Dependency selection criteria live in `docs/decisions/006-dependency-philosophy.md`.

### Never do
- Skip validation or bypass hooks
- Break the dependency order intentionally
- Commit secrets or credentials
- Modify `.git/` directly
- Force-push shared history
- Keep commented-out code or untracked TODOs

## Task Loop

The harness runtime is a contract-driven loop:

1. `bun run harness:init -- <name>` personalizes the template
2. Update `docs/product.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
3. `bun run harness:plan` synchronizes milestones/tasks into:
   - `docs/progress.md`
   - `.harness/state.json`
4. `bun run harness:orchestrate` prepares the next task contract
5. Implement inside the task scope
6. `bun run harness:evaluate --task <id>` records pass/fail and handoff artifacts
7. Use milestone worktrees only through `harness:parallel-dispatch` and `harness:merge-milestone`

Canonical surfaces:
- `docs/product.md`: PRD canon
- `docs/architecture.md`: architecture canon
- `docs/progress.md`: human-readable execution view
- `.harness/state.json`: machine execution state
- `.harness/contracts/`, `.harness/evaluations/`, `.harness/handoffs/`: task artifacts

Use `bun run harness:status --json` for a structured snapshot of the current state.
Use `bun run harness:state-recover --list` or `--latest` if state recovery is needed.

## Layer Model

| Layer | Typical Role | Allowed Imports |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| `types` | schemas, types, constants | none |
| `config` | env, flags, config loaders | `types` |
| `repo` | persistence, external adapters | `types`, `config` |
| `service` | business logic, workflows | `types`, `config`, `repo` |
| `runtime` | handlers, servers, CLI entrypoints | `types`, `config`, `repo`, `service` |
| `ui` | components, views, pages | all layers |

Notes:
- `apps/*/src/index.ts` and `packages/*/src/index.ts` are allowed unlayered entrypoints.
- Cross-workspace imports must go through package exports, never another workspace's internal files.
- The machine-readable enforcement lives in `harness/rules/dependency-layers.json`.

---

## Validation

Full gate:

```bash
bun run harness:validate
bun run harness:validate:full
```

Use `bun run harness:validate` for the default local handoff gate.
Use `bun run harness:validate:full` in CI or when changing harness runtime behavior.

Useful slices:

```bash
bun run harness:doctor
bun run harness:lint
bun run harness:structural
bun run harness:entropy
bun run harness:status --json
```

## Skills

Load skills on demand. Start with the minimum set.

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `skills/research/SKILL.md` | unfamiliar area, unclear existing pattern |
| `skills/implementation/SKILL.md` | feature work or significant refactors |
| `skills/testing/SKILL.md` | test additions or coverage work |
| `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` | review, validation, merge readiness |
| `skills/debugging/SKILL.md` | bug reproduction, log-driven debugging, observability checks |
| `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` | pre-PR or deployment prep |

If a change spans multiple files or phases, create an execution plan in `docs/execution-plans/`.
The current harness improvement plan lives in `docs/execution-plans/harness-agent-ergonomics.md`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bun run harness:init -- <name>` | personalize the template |
| `bun run harness:discover --reset` | guided PRD/architecture discovery |
| `bun run harness:plan` | sync backlog from docs |
| `bun run harness:status --json` | structured current-state summary |
| `bun run harness:orchestrate` | prepare the next task contract |

| `bun run build` / `lint` / `typecheck` / `test` | workspace-wide checks |

Full command availability is generated into `docs/internal/command-surface.md`.
