		"prd.problem-statement":
			"**Current state:** New repositories often start as a loose collection of setup scripts, incomplete docs, and implicit conventions.\n\n**The gap:** Engineers and coding agents lose time rebuilding the same repository scaffolding, guessing architecture rules, and deciding how to organize the first production slice.\n\n**Impact:** Teams spend their early project time on setup churn instead of feature delivery, and quality drifts because the working agreements are not encoded in the repository.",
		"prd.target-audience":
			"| Persona | Description | Primary Goal |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| Founding engineer | Starts a new product codebase and needs a production-shaped repo immediately | Land the first vertical slice without rebuilding tooling |\n| Platform or tech lead | Standardizes how agents and humans work in the same repository | Provide repeatable structure, validation, and handoff rules |\n| Product engineer using agents | Edits application code with AI assistance every day | Work inside a repo whose conventions are obvious and enforceable |",

			"### Must Have (v1)\n- [ ] Ready-to-edit monorepo layout with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/shared`\n- [ ] Root validation and task orchestration that work immediately after initialization\n- [ ] Repository-owned docs and rules that agents can follow without extra chat context\n\n### Should Have (v1)\n- [ ] Guided discovery flow for teams that want PRD and architecture interviews before implementation\n- [ ] Milestone and task planning generated from repository docs\n\n### Could Have (later)\n- [ ] Optional deployment presets per application workspace\n- [ ] Additional shared package templates for design systems or SDKs\n\n### Won't Have (out of scope)\n- One-click product-specific frameworks or business logic beyond the engineering scaffold",
		"prd.scope-boundaries":
			"**In scope:**\n- A working engineer template with monorepo structure, validation, docs, and planning surfaces\n- Minimal application and shared package scaffolds that compile and test\n- Optional discovery/orchestration tooling for teams that want a more guided workflow\n\n**Out of scope:**\n- Product-specific UI, domain models, or deployment infrastructure\n- Framework-specific code generation for every possible stack choice\n- Automatic feature implementation beyond the scaffold itself",

		"prd.assumptions-constraints":
			"**Assumptions:**\n- Teams want a strong default repository shape but still need to customize product details quickly\n- Bun and git are available in the development environment\n- The first shipped work will usually span at least one app workspace and one shared package\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The template must stay framework-agnostic at the business-logic level\n- Rules must remain repository-owned and executable offline\n- The default path must not require discovery interviews before coding can begin",
