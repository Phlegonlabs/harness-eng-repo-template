# Applications

Place runnable workspaces in `apps/*`.

Recommended defaults in this template:

- `apps/web` for UI or client-facing code
- `apps/api` for API, worker, or server runtime code

Each workspace should keep its internal code organized by the dependency layer model:

`types → config → repo → service → runtime → ui`

Cross-workspace sharing should happen through package exports from `packages/*`.
