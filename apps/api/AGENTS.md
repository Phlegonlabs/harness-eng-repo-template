# apps/api AGENTS.md

Read the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) first. This file adds workspace-specific guidance for `apps/api`.

---

## Purpose

`apps/api` is the runtime-oriented application workspace for server and handler code. Treat it as the boundary layer that wires shared business logic into HTTP, worker, or CLI entrypoints.

---

## Layer Guidance

The harness linter allows all six layers in this workspace:

`Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI`

Typical API usage is narrower:
- `src/index.ts` is the unlayered workspace entrypoint.
- `src/runtime/` owns handlers, transport glue, and process startup.
- UI is allowed by the rule model but is not the normal shape for this workspace.

---

## Conventions

- Keep transport-specific logic in `src/runtime/`.
- Move reusable business rules down into `@harness-template/shared` or a lower layer inside this workspace.
- Use the shared structured logger instead of `console.*` or direct stream writes.
- Import across workspaces only through package exports such as `@harness-template/shared`.

---

## Validation

- Run `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, and `bun run typecheck` from this workspace when changing API code.
- Run `bun run harness:validate` from the repo root before handoff.
