# apps/web AGENTS.md

Read the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) first. This file adds workspace-specific guidance for `apps/web`.

---

## Purpose

`apps/web` is the application workspace for user-facing UI code. Keep UI-specific decisions here and consume shared code through `@harness-template/shared`.

---

## Layer Guidance

The harness linter allows all six layers in this workspace:

`Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI`

Current template usage is intentionally light:
- `src/index.ts` is the unlayered workspace entrypoint.
- `src/ui/` is the primary implementation area today.
- Additional layers are allowed when the product requires them, but they must still follow the dependency order above.

---

## Conventions

- Put presentational components, pages, and view helpers in `src/ui/`.
- Keep route and entry wiring in `src/index.ts` or future `src/runtime/` entrypoints.
- Prefer naming features by user-facing domain, not by framework primitive.
- Import shared behavior through package exports only. Do not deep-import from another workspace's `src/`.

---

## Validation

- Run `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, and `bun run typecheck` from this workspace when changing web code.
- Run `bun run harness:validate` from the repo root before handoff.
