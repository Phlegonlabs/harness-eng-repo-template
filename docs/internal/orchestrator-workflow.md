# Orchestrator Workflow

This repository uses a single orchestration model for Codex and Claude.

The planning and execution sequence is:

1. `bun run harness:init -- <name>` personalizes the engineer-template baseline and leaves the repo ready to customize.
2. `docs/product.md` captures product intent, success criteria, scope, and proposed milestones.
3. `docs/architecture.md` captures system shape, constraints, module boundaries, and milestone-splitting constraints.
4. `bun run harness:plan` validates both docs and synchronizes:
   - `docs/progress.md`
   - `.harness/state.json`
5. Milestones become the top-level executable units.
6. Tasks are executed inside one milestone at a time.
7. Different milestones may run in parallel through isolated git worktrees.

Optional path:

- `bun run harness:discover --reset` re-enters guided discovery mode and rewrites the PRD/architecture from interview answers.

## Canonical Surfaces

| Surface | Role |
|--------|------|
| `docs/product.md` | PRD canon |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Architecture canon |
| `docs/progress.md` | Human-readable backlog and execution status |
| `.harness/state.json` | Machine-owned execution state |
| `harness/skills/registry.json` | Skill-loading policy and runtime defaults |

---

## Planning Contract

Backlog generation is blocked until all three conditions are true:

- `docs/product.md` no longer contains template placeholders
- `docs/architecture.md` no longer contains template placeholders
- `docs/product.md` includes a `## Proposed Milestones` section with milestone bullets

Those conditions can be satisfied in two ways:

- `harness:init -- <name>` seeds a ready engineer baseline with valid milestones
- `harness:discover --reset` walks the team through guided PRD and architecture questions
When the conditions are met, `harness:plan` generates milestone records and placeholder tasks.

## Milestone and Task Model

Milestones are the unit of parallelism.

Each milestone records:

- `id`
- `title`
- `goal`
- `status`
- `dependsOn`
- `parallelEligible`
- `affectedAreas`
- `worktreeName`

Each task records:

- `id`
- `milestoneId`
- `title`
- `kind`
- `status`
- `dependsOn`
- `affectedFilesOrAreas`
- `requiredSkills`
- `validationChecks`

Tasks inside one milestone are serial by default.
Only read-only sidecars may overlap inside the same milestone.

---

## Parallel Dispatch

`bun run harness:parallel-dispatch -- --apply` may allocate worktrees for milestones only when:

- the milestone has no unmet dependency
- `parallelEligible` is true
- its `affectedAreas` do not overlap with active milestones

The dispatcher records worktree ownership in `.harness/state.json`.

---

## Skill Loading

Skills follow progressive disclosure:

1. The runtime reads `harness/skills/registry.json`
2. It selects candidate skills from the current phase and task kind
3. It loads only the skill paths needed for the current task
4. It records the loaded skills in `.harness/state.json`

Codex and Claude must follow the same registry and triggers.
