# Observability

This project uses structured JSON logging as the default debugging surface for agents and humans.

---

## Logging Contract

- Use the shared logger from `@harness-template/shared`.
- Emit machine-readable JSON lines with `ts`, `level`, `message`, and optional `context`.
- Prefer stable context keys such as `workspace`, `component`, `requestId`, and `statusCode`.
- Treat `console.*` and direct stream writes as violations outside the shared logger implementation.

---

## Local Access

- Run the relevant workspace command and inspect stdout/stderr directly.
- Pipe logs through filters that preserve one-JSON-object-per-line semantics.
- Reproduce the failure before adding new instrumentation.

Example:

```bash
cd apps/api
bun run dev
```

---

## Agent Workflow

1. Reproduce the bug with the smallest reliable command or test.
2. Find the last trustworthy structured log entry before the failure.
3. Add the narrowest missing log signal needed to disambiguate state.
4. Fix the bug.
5. Re-run the failing path and confirm the new log sequence matches the intended control flow.

If the debugging path reveals a reusable operational lesson, record it in `docs/` before handoff.

## Metrics And Traces

The template does not ship a metrics or tracing backend by default.

- Add metrics only when a product requirement justifies the extra surface area.
- Document any future trace or metrics integration in an ADR before rollout.
- Keep log semantics stable even if metrics or tracing are added later.
