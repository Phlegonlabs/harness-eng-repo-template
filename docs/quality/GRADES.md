## Grading Scale

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **A** | Production-ready, well-tested, well-documented |
| **B** | Functional, some gaps in tests or docs |
| **C** | Works but needs attention (tech debt, missing tests) |
| **D** | Fragile, known issues, needs refactor |
| **F** | Broken or severely degraded |

## How to Update

When a domain or layer grade changes:

1. Update the table above.
2. Add specific action items for anything below B.
3. Create ADRs for significant architectural decisions that affected the grade.
4. Run `bun run harness:entropy` to check for pattern drift.

Entropy scans run weekly (via `.github/workflows/harness-validate.yml`) and may surface issues to address here.
