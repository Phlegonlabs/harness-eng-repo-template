# Skill: Deployment

Use this skill when preparing a PR, creating a release, or deploying changes.

## PR Checklist

Before opening a PR:

1. **Validation passes**
   ```bash
   ./harness/scripts/validate.sh
   ```

2. **Branch is up to date with main**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. **Commit messages follow conventional commits**
   - `feat(scope): add project stats endpoint`
   - `fix(scope): handle null user in auth middleware`
   - `docs(scope): add ADR for caching strategy`
   - `harness(rules): tighten file-size limit`
   - `chore(deps): upgrade dependencies`

4. **PR description includes**
   - What changed and why
   - Link to ticket/issue (if applicable)
   - Screenshot or test output if applicable

## Opening a PR (GitHub CLI)

gh pr create \
  --title "feat(projects): add stats endpoint" \
  --body "## What
[What changed]

## Why
[Why it was needed / issue link]

## Testing

  --base main
```

## After PR is Merged

- [ ] Verify CI passed on main
