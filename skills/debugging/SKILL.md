# Skill: Debugging

Use this skill when reproducing bugs, tracing failures, or validating a fix through logs and observability signals.

## Debugging Loop

1. Reproduce the issue with the smallest reliable command or test.
2. Inspect structured logs before changing code.
3. Add or refine logging only where the missing signal blocks diagnosis.
4. Implement the smallest fix that resolves the observed failure mode.
5. Re-run the reproduction path and confirm the logs now show the expected state.

## Logging Rules

- Prefer the shared structured logger from `@harness-template/shared`.
- Log stable fields such as `requestId`, `workspace`, `component`, `taskId`, or `statusCode`.
- Put volatile payloads inside a nested context object instead of flattening everything at the top level.
- Do not leave temporary debug noise behind after the fix is verified.

## What to Check

- Reproduction command or failing test
- Before/after log output
- Error-path coverage
- Docs or runbooks if the debugging path taught the next agent something durable

## Useful Commands

```bash
bun run harness:validate
bun run harness:validate:full
bun run harness:self-review
```

## Example Flow

1. Run the failing path.
2. Look for the last correct structured log entry.
3. Add one focused log line at the branch that becomes ambiguous.
4. Fix the branch condition or missing data flow.
5. Re-run the failing path and remove any temporary instrumentation that is no longer needed.
